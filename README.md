# Best Movies on Streaming thanks to Python

Similar to the first part of the project, but in this case I decided to look for the best movies. Also in this case, the script will return to the user an excel file, with a sheet for each streaming service.

This was made possible thanks to a dataset downloaded from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/movies-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney
